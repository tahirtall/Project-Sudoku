Sudoku Rules:

    -> numbers of 1-9 used
    -> made up of 9x9 square, divided in to 3x3 squares in itself.
    -> each 3x3 square has to be filled with number 1-9 without having any repeating number.
    -> numbers in rows and columns of 9x9 square can't be repeating as well.

My Rules:

    -> in my program 0s will be representing blank spaces.
