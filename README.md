Project-Sudoku:

Sudoku Rules:

        -> numbers of 1-9 used
        -> made up of 9x9 square, divided in to 3x3 squares in itself.
        -> each 3x3 square has to be filled with number 1-9 without having any repeating number.
        -> numbers in rows and columns of 9x9 square can't be repeating as well.

My Rules:
        
        -> 0s will be representing blank spaces.

Grid:

        [0, 7, 2, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 0]
        [3, 0, 4, 0, 8, 9, 1, 0, 0]
        [8, 1, 9, 0, 0, 6, 2, 5, 4]
        [7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5]
        [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0]
        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 1, 2]
        [4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 6, 2, 0]
        [2, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1]
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 7, 0, 0]

Progress:

    -> Iterated through the 2D Array.
    -> Created a txt file and passed all of the integers that will be used to create the 2D ArrayList.
    -> Read in the file, and added all of the integers from the txt file to the arraylist.
